# Power BI & Business Intelligence Portfolio

Hi! I'm Nadya, a Business Information Systems student. This repository is a collection of my projects where I transform raw data into interactive dashboards. It documents my journey of learning how to handle data—starting from simple cleaning to building full-scale business reports that help in making better decisions.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Fixing messy data and preparing it for analysis.
* **Data Modeling:** Connecting different data tables to work together seamlessly.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Writing formulas for custom calculations and business metrics.
* **Data Visualization:** Choosing the right charts to tell a clear story.
* **Dashboard Design:** Creating user-friendly layouts that are easy to navigate.
* **Business Insight Analysis:** Finding the "why" behind the numbers to provide actionable advice.

## Tools Used
* **Power BI Desktop** (Main tool for modeling and visualization)
* **Microsoft Excel** (Data sourcing and initial prep)
* **SQL Concepts** (Basic data querying and structuring)

## Featured Project: Indian Domestic Airline Market Analysis

For my final project, I analyzed the domestic airline market in India to help a potential investor group understand the competitive landscape. I focused on identifying which routes are the most profitable and how pricing changes during the "Wedding Season" and "Summer Holidays."

The dashboard reveals critical insights, such as the revenue gap between non-stop and transit flights, and identifies the peak booking hours where demand is highest. By looking at these patterns, I was able to recommend specific entry strategies for a new airline, such as focusing on high-traffic routes like Delhi to Mumbai.

### Practice Highlights: Sales Performance Dashboard
Throughout the course, I also developed various reports to practice specific BI techniques. This dashboard from my reporting module focuses on sales growth, region performance, and product profitability.
